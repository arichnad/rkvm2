# rkvm2
rusty kvm based on the great work done here https://github.com/htrefil/rkvm.  The big differences are:
1. Connectionless
2. Disconnected the input server from the main app
3. Clipboard integration
4. Notification integration

Lots of work to be done, including:
1. encryption over the net
2. cli for fun stuff
3. doesn't really work well yet lol
4. Screen geometry support?
